Raspberry Pi 2 GPIO Pins Reference
==================================

[Go to the reference page!](https://aziraphale.github.io/pi-pins/)
--------------------------------------

This is a simple HTML page to display a comprehensive overview of the "GPIO" pins on a Raspberry Pi 2.

Most of the pin details will also apply to other Raspberry Pi models, but the Pi 2 is the model that I have and am therefore most interested in. Due to the Pi 2 being quite new (as of the time of writing), it also doesn't have quite the wealth of information on the Web that the original Pi models have.

Since I found that I was constantly having to flick between at least five different reference pages in order to get all the data I needed, I decided to bring it all together into one diagram and make it available for anyone else to use.

This reference makes use of GitHub Pages, so [its git repository is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/aziraphale/pi-pins/) and so is [the HTML page served from GitHub](https://aziraphale.github.io/pi-pins/). This has the advantage that anyone can fork the site, make improvements/corrections/changes, and then issue pull requests to allow me to pull the changes back into this site!
